## Instructions

In this project the main goal is to work with JavaScript and the DOM. So the skeleton and the styles are tooked from the starter code that Udacity allows to use. A little from that part was modifidied but in overall everything it is without touching.

So to work on this project we need the navbar to build up dinamically, reviewing other projects I notese that almost all have add sections dinamically to, so I did to. The after that we need to scroll to section viewed when we click in an anchor. And finally we need a way to add an active class to the sections been viewed.

## Index.html

So like it was told before right here we have our skeleton, that is in the majority without modifications, so we can reference all the JavaScript in the js file. 

## App.js

Right here we have our functionality, working with the DOM and JavaScript. In this part the work done does what it is intented to do. I could be refactored to be much cleaner and logical. 

So the code in this part has a lot of research to make it work but it needs more reading and understanding to do it better.

## Styles.css

In this part we have our styles and it is clean, there is no modification whatsoever.
